"""Write a program that reads strings (without digits or symbols in the string) typed by the
user until an empty string is entered. For each string, convert all words to lowercase, then sort and
print the words into descending order lexicographically. Hint: use split function to split a string into
a list, then sort it with a method.
Testing: Test your code with the example output above.
How would you change the code above to first read in all the strings until an empty string is
entered? Think of two different approaches.
If you havenâ€™t done it already, change your code by writing your own function to sort a
string after splitting the words.
